A user will be able to sign up and log into the Remember Me app—a personal journal of favorite things. Once logged in, the user will be able to fill out a form and file a favorite thing. On the favorite thing form, each individual favorite thing has a category, name, notes, and URL, which users can later access. The user will be able to see all their favorite things including links on one page.

 Favorite thing about Buffy at 5 months
Her raw enthusiasm when doing tricks when there’s food involved. Asking for a down, she will severely plump to the floor with sound so she knows she means business—for a treat.

	•	User
	•	user=(associate)
	•	build_user(attributes = {})
	•	create_user(attributes = {})
	•	create_user!(attributes = {})
	•	reload_user

	•	Favorite
	•	favorite=(associate)
	•	build_favorite(attributes = {})
	•	create_favorite(attributes = {})
	•	create_favorite!(attributes = {})
	•	reload_favorite


#double pipes// or equals // if a is undefined or falsey, 
#then evaluate b and set a to the result
