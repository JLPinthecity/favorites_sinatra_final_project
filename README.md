# Remember Me

Remember Me is a MVC app, created using Sinatra, that helps users keep track of their favorite things. 

I built this Favorite Things tracker as a part of the Flatiron School's Full-Stack Web Dev curriculum. More details about my coding process can be found [here.](https://joannpan.medium.com/how-to-make-a-sinatra-web-app-my-entire-planning-and-coding-process-45b92123ef5d)
